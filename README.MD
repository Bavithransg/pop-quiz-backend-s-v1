# Welcome to this PopQuiz!
### { "Engineer": "Backend" }

Hey! We are excited that you are interested in joining the team at Regov Technologies.

We feel that the best way for you to produce your best codes is when you hit flow in your comfort zone. Therefore, this is a pop-quiz for you to complete. This test should not take you a long amount of time to complete.

Demonstrate your problem solving skills and understanding of core data structures by attempting both questions. The questions are open to interpretation and implementation.

### Coding Challenge

## Question 1

Write a API for the following school registration system. The system should allow students to register for courses and administrators to manage the course offerings and student enrollment. The following requirements should be met:

1. Students should be able to view a list of available courses and enroll in them if seats are available.
2. Courses should have a maximum enrollment capacity that is set by the administrator. If a course reaches its maximum capacity, students should no longer be able to enroll in it.
3. Administrators should be able to add new courses to the system, with a specified maximum capacity.
4. Administrators should be able to view a list of all courses and the number of students currently enrolled in each course.
5. Administrators should be able to view a list of all students enrolled in a particular course.
6. Students should be able to drop a course they have enrolled in, and the capacity of the course should be updated accordingly.
7. The system should be able to handle concurrent requests from multiple users, ensuring that no two users can enroll in the same course at the same time.
8. The system should maintain a record of all course enrollments and drops, and provide an interface for administrators to view this information.


## Question 2 - Data structures:

### Exercise 1: Priority Queue

Implement a priority queue data structure that supports the following methods:

insert(item, priority): adds an item to the priority queue with a given priority
pop(): removes and returns the item with the highest priority (i.e., the lowest priority number)
peek(): returns the item with the highest priority without removing it
isEmpty(): returns true if the priority queue is empty, false otherwise.

### Notes

- Use Node.js | Python
- Apply your preferred coding structure
- Unit test is an added advantage
- Add README
- Produce use case or class diagram for the system architecture 
- Writing design documents will attract extra points :)
